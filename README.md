# Web_Spider

<h1> Description: </h1>
This python script gives two different options in enumerating website pages. One is by recursively going through href links. The other involves you choosing or making a word list and the scipt sending requests to specified-url{wordlist-line} and returning the user their response code ie: 403, 200, 502, etc. 

<h1> Prerequisites: </h1>
Python 3.X.X is required, besides that this uses built in python modules so there is no pip install required.

<h1>Disclaimer: </h1>
I created this tool with the intention of learning and improving my skills. Please be aware that it should only be used on web domains that you have the proper authority over. If you're looking for a place to test it out and don't have one, I suggest setting up your own Apache2 server on a Linux platform. This can be done quite easily and will provide a safe environment for testing.
